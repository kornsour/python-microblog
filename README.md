# python-microblog

Microblog with Flask and MongoDB, deployed on Heroku

## Devcontainer

This repo uses a [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container) for development.

It leverages [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) to deploy containers for MongoDB and Flask.

## Starting the app

Run `flask run` to start the app once the container is up and running.
